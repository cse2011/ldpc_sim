# ldpc_sim
Simulation of LDPC codes, with 802.11 matrices included

The C++ code in this repo simulates the belief propagation decoding of LDPC packets with AWGN noise. It is 
possible to set up QAM modulations (included up to 64-QAM) by adding files in the "maps" folder, and to add
codes by adding files in the "matrices" folder.
